## Help
I used Abbabon's Dracula theme (https://github.com/dracula/aseprite), as a starting point, but edited pretty much everything to the point it was a new file entirely.

Any inquiries about changes or other you can open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Calart/Synthwave/issues/new/choose "New Issue &#183; https://github.com/Calart/Synthwave") or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pronomicalart).

## License
This theme is based on the default theme of [Aseprite](http://aseprite.org "Aseprite - Animated sprite editor & pixel art tool") by Ilija Melentijevic & David Capello.  
Therefore the [Aseprite Eula](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/EULA.txt "aseprite/EULA.txt at master &#183; aseprite/aseprite") applies on this project, too.
