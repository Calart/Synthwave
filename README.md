## Help
Most of the sheet was edited while making this theme. I used Abbabon's Dracula theme (https://github.com/dracula/aseprite), as a starting point. 
Open an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/calart/aseprite-synthwave-theme/issues/new "New Issue &#183; calart/aseprite-synthwave-theme") or message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pronomicalart).

## License
This theme is based on the default theme of [Aseprite](http://aseprite.org "Aseprite - Animated sprite editor & pixel art tool") by Ilija Melentijevic & David Capello.  
Therefore the [Aseprite Eula](https://github.com/aseprite/aseprite/blob/master/EULA.txt "aseprite/EULA.txt at master &#183; aseprite/aseprite") applies on this project, too.

The Synthwave theme is subject to the [MIT License](./LICENSE).
